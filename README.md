## Troubleshooting

- If you see an error about the OpenAI API key, ensure your `.env` file exists and is in the same directory as `chat_youtube.py`.
- If the logo does not appear, make sure `planAI.png` is in the same directory as the script.
- If you get transcript errors, the video may not have a transcript available.
